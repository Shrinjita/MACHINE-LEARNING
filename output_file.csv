This project aims to develop a compact and robust UAV-mountable tunable laser-based methane detection system. Such systems have emerged as an extremely useful method of monitoring large areas and tight spaces. Examples include monitoring methane in the oil and gas industry, nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural fields and sensing toxic fumes in coal mines or ship breaking yards. You will work with mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers, photodetectors, lock-in amplifier, Raspberry Pi / Python-based data acquisition and processing. You will be taught how to perform such laser-based sensing by a PhD student and would thereafter have to 3D print the methane sensing system and demonstrate it in the lab and outdoors. If all goes well, you will mount the system on a UAV and make air-borne measurements. The work is challenging and rewarding.

IP0HS0100001,Modelling the mechanical response of self-healing materials,"Self-healing materials can recover strength and stiffness upon damage through different healing mechanisms. These healing mechanisms in materials are either characteristic of certain materials (called intrinsic healing) or are artificially introduced (called extrinsic healing). Experimental investigations on self-healing polymers have been actively performed over the last few decades, and such polymers can find wide applications in biomedical, aerospace, automotive, and electronics industries. A promising computational approach to model these polymers is developing a stress-strain model to capture the damage and healing in these materials under different loading conditions. This project is focused on developing a damage-healing model that captures the mechanical response of such self-healing polymers. A damage parameter, which captures the degradation in the material, and a healing variable, which captures the recovery in the material, will be defined. The stress-strain response of the polymer under different loading conditions will be analyzed by integrating the damage-healing model in a finite element framework using MATLAB. The polymer will be modelled as a viscoelastic material, which exhibits both an elastic response like a solid and a time-dependent response like a fluid.

IP0HS0100002,Computational modelling of fatigue damage in fibre-reinforced composites,"A composite material is formed by combining two or more materials with different physical properties. Fibre-reinforced composites have a matrix phase in which fibres are embedded as reinforcements. They find applications in aerospace, automotive, and renewable energy industries owing to their high strength-to-weight ratio, resistance to thermal expansion, and high stiffness-to-weight ratio. Composites exhibit direction-dependent response and complex failure mechanisms such as cracking of the matrix phase, debonding of fibre and matrix, and even fracture of fibres. Composites under fatigue loading (e.g., a composite wind turbine blade) undergo progressive damage and degradation in material properties. Unlike metals, complete experimental characterisation of fibre-reinforced composites is challenging as their response is direction-dependent and markedly different under tension and compression. Computation models capturing damage and stiffness degradation of composites under fatigue loading are crucial to predict the design lifecycle accurately. This project aims to develop a mechanics-based model for predicting fatigue damage in composites by developing a stress-strain model and coupling it to a finite element framework. Damage parameters will be defined to track the degradation in stiffness properties due to different failure mechanisms. These parameters will be coupled with the stress-strain relation governing the mechanical response of the composite. The student will have the opportunity to learn about composites and failure modes in composites and develop a computational model on MATLAB to study the fatigue response of fibre-reinforced composites.",Harini Subramanian,Apply Here,In Person Mode

This jumping-droplet condensation phenomenon has demonstrated improvements in heat transfer, anti-icing properties, and self-cleaning efficiency. In this project, our focus is to experimentally investigate multidroplet coalescence. We will employ high-speed imaging from side-view and top-view perspectives to analyze numerous jumping events on a copper oxide nanostructured superhydrophobic surface. Our goal is to explore the various mechanisms that lead to droplet jumping scenarios. Additionally, we will measure droplet-jumping speeds across a range of droplet radii to gain insights into the capillary-to-inertial energy conversion mechanism.",Uddipta Ghosh,Apply Here,In Person Mode
IP0UM0000003,Web and Mobile Portal for Seismic Waveform Picking,"The arrival times of the seismic waves are often the most important parameters in determination of earthquake attributes like magnitude, location and focal mechanism. However, this work is often done by a single seismologist. We want to crowdsource seismic waveform picking, for which a platform like mobile app would be ideal. Crowd sourced seismic phase selection outperforms any automated picker as humans are much superior at recognising patterns and as the majority of the arrival times accessible for existing data have no uncertainty data connected with them, AI systems trained on them are only as good or poor as the few people who performed the choosing in the first place.",Utsav Mannu,Apply Here,In Person Mode
IP0VJ0000009,1. Development of an approach for mineral tonnage estimation using physical characteristics of minerals at different grain sizes,"Consistent estimation of mineral tonnage for different grain sizes is a major challenge, as bulk density varies with grain size due to porosity change. The project aims to analyses large number of samples of different minerals in lab. The lab data will be used to define a new approach for consistent estimation of mineral tonnage.",Vikrant Jain,Apply Here,In Person Mode

IP0VV0000011,Wearable robotic exoskeleton for human movement assistance,"Exoskeletons are robotic systems that are used in parallel with a human body segment for assisting disabled individuals. In our lab, we are developing wearable robotic exoskeletons that are light-weight, flexible, and can be worn on legs, arms, or trunk. This project will involve activities, such as design and development, control, and testing, to apply controlled external forces during movement tasks, such as walking, lifting weight, drawing, etc.",Vineet Vashista,Apply Here,In Person Mode

IP0VV0000012,Outdoor Aerial Transportation using Quadcopters,"Deploying quadcopters for aerial transportation can be cost effective in impromptu material handling applications. However, such applications are limited mainly due to the requirement of onboard localization sensors and associated computation. This project explores different collaboration modalities, such as human-quadcopter or multiple quadcopters, to successfully execute spontaneous outdoor flight of a quadcopter with a payload.",Vineet Vashista,Apply Here,In Person Mode
